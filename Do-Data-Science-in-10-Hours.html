<div id="what-is-this-book-why-to-read-it" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.1</span> What is this book? Why to read it?</h2>
<p>This book is originated from my Data Science course. It was in the lab sessions, where students practice different steps in the workflow of Data Science projects. Students enjoyed the detailed practices using different methods and different algorithms to solve analytical problems. To my surprise, we only find out later, that the student failed to grasp the real meaning of doing data science, which is not to provide an absolutely working solution to a problem, rather, an experimental interpretation of data at hand. In other words, you are just telling other propel what the data is telling you. You are not using data to solve problems that data has not provide any solution to you! They appeared also lost the track of doing a data science project. stuck at circles between two steps and failed to move foreword.</p>
<p>I did a short tutorial for my students. the tutorial was emphasizing on the process and workflow of doing a data science project. That short tutorial was extremely successful and welcomed by all students, particularly the students who is not from computer Science, software engineering, Statistics, applied math, rather, from information science and management science.</p>
<p>So, I suppose this book is practical for students who has no background of computing and programming knowledge but interested in doing data science project or move to data science in the future.</p>
<p>It is introduction level book for novelty students who want learn data science in short period time perhaps a few days or at their winter or summer holidays.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.3</span> What Can This Course Offer You?</h2>
<p>This book offers a short practical course.</p>
<p>This course will bring you:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Understand the data analysis procedure</li>
<li>Familiar with R language</li>
<li>Using RStudio to do your prototype of data project</li>
<li>Data preprocess - manipulate data for further analysis</li>
<li>Manage basic methods like Descriptive, Exploratory and Predictive data analysis</li>
<li>Have basic skills of visualize data results</li>
<li>Basic interpretation of you analyzing results and communicate with others</li>
<li>Report your results</li>
<li>Enter the data science community</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="schedule" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.4</span> Schedule</h2>
<p>is specifically designed for students who has no background of much Algorithms, programming and even computing. The basic requirements are desire to learn, attitude of humble and diligence of working. All that mean you need to get your hand dirty, spent time and do more practices. At the end, it cannot guaranty you become a data scientist but it will help you find the way to wards doing data science and be confident to start doing data science projects. It is certainty that if you persist on this road, you will no doubt becomes a future data scientist.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.5</span> Notes</h2>
<p>Our goal is not to teach you R, but to teach you the basic process of doing a data science project that many other programming language like Java and Python can do. We use R in our lessons because:</p>
<ul>
<li>we have to use something for examples;</li>
<li>it’s free, well-documented, and runs almost everywhere;</li>
<li>it has a large (and growing) user base among scientists; and</li>
<li>it has a large library of external packages available for performing diverse tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the two most important things are to use whatever language your colleagues are using, so you can share your work with them easily, and to use that language well. apparently. R is the most used language in Data Science</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> What is Data Science?</h2>
<p>Data science is a multidisciplinary filed. It blends of data mining, data analysis, statistics, algorithm development, machine learning and advanced computing and software technology together in order to solve analytically complex problems. Its ultimate goal is to reveal insight of data and get the data value for business.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> Data science as Discovery of Data Insight</h3>
<p>This aspect of data science is all about uncovering hidden patterns from data. Diving in at a granular level to mine and understand complex patterns, trends, and relations. It’s about surfacing hidden insight that can help and enable companies to make smarter business decisions and take appropriate actions to gain competitive advantages in the market. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon build recommendation system to provide users suggestion on purchase based on the user’s shopping history.</li>
<li>Netflix data mines movie viewing patterns to understand what drives user interest, and uses that to make decisions on which Netflix original series to produce.</li>
<li>Target identifies what are major customer segments within it’s base and the unique shopping behaviors within those segments, which helps to guide messaging to different market audiences.</li>
<li>Proctor &amp; Gamble utilizes time series models to more clearly understand future demand, which help plan for production levels more optimally.
How do data scientists mine out insights? It starts with data exploration. When given a challenging question, data scientists become detectives. They investigate leads and try to understand pattern or characteristics within the data. This requires a big dose of analytical creativity.</li>
</ul>
<p>How do data scientists mine data insights? there is a procedure to follow. It generally starts with data description it is called Described data analysis (DDA) to get first sight on the data sets available. DDS will help data scientist to grasp the quantity and quality of the data. so they can decide how to deal with the data. it then generally followed by data cleaning, manipulation, transform and attributes engineering etc, together called preprocess. Data preprocess is also generally combined with exploratory data analysis (EDA). When given a challenging question, data scientists normally become detectives. They investigate all the information available and follow any possible leads and try to understand pattern or characteristics within the data. This not only requires huge amount tools and techniques but also demand analytical creativity .</p>
<p>Then as needed, data scientists may apply quantitative technique in order to get a level deeper – e.g. statistical methods, projections, inferential models, segmentation analysis, time series forecasting, synthetic control experiments, etc. The intent is to scientifically piece together a forensic view of what the data is really saying.</p>
<p>This data-driven insight is central to providing strategic guidance. In this sense, data scientists act as consultants, information provider help business stakeholders on how to act on findings.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-science-as-development-of-data-product" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> Data science as Development of Data Product</h3>
<p>A “data product” is a technical asset that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>utilizes data as input, and</li>
<li>processes that data to return algorithmically-generated results.</li>
</ol>
<p>A typical example is users’ scoring system. It takes users profile or/and behavior data as input and with a complex scoring engine, it produces a credit score of the users for business decision making.
Another example of a data product is a recommendation engine, which ingests user data, and makes personalized recommendations based on that data.
Here are some examples of data products:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon’s recommendation engines suggest items for you to buy, determined by their algorithms.</li>
<li>Netflix recommends movies to you. Spotify recommends music to you.</li>
<li>Gmail’s spam filter is data product – an algorithm behind the scenes processes incoming mail and determines if a message is junk or not.</li>
<li>Computer vision used for self-driving cars is also data product – machine learning algorithms are able to recognize traffic lights, other cars on the road, pedestrians, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is different from the “data insights” section above, where the outcome to that is to perhaps provide advice to an executive to make a smarter business decision. In contrast, a data product is technical functionality that encapsulates an algorithm, and is designed to integrate directly into core applications. Respective examples of applications that incorporate data product behind the scenes: Amazon’s homepage, Gmail’s inbox, and autonomous driving software.</p>
<p>Data scientists play a central role in developing data product. This involves building out algorithms, as well as testing, refinement, and technical deployment into production systems. In this sense, data scientists serve as technical developers, building assets that can be leveraged at wide scale.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> What is Data Scientist?</h2>
<p>Data scientists are a new breed of analytical data expert who have the technical skills to solve complex problems – and the curiosity to explore what problems need to be solved. They are part mathematician, part computer scientist and part business trend-spotter. They straddle in both the business and IT worlds with mathematical and programming weaponry.</p>

<div id="mathematics-narrator" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1.1</span> Mathematics Narrator</h4>
<p>At the heart of mining data insight and building data product is the ability to view the data through a quantitative lens. There are textures, dimensions, and correlations in data that can be expressed mathematically. Finding solutions utilizing data becomes a brain teaser of heuristics and quantitative technique. Solutions to many business problems involve building analytic models grounded in the hard math, where being able to understand the underlying mechanics of those models is key to success in building them.</p>
<p>Also, a misconception is that data science all about <strong>statistics</strong>. While statistics is important, it is not the only type of math utilized. First, there are two branches of statistics – classical statistics and Bayesian statistics. When most people refer to stats they are generally referring to classical statistics, but knowledge of both types is helpful. Furthermore, many inferential techniques and machine learning algorithms lean on knowledge of <strong>linear algebra</strong>. For example, a popular method to discover hidden characteristics in a data set is SVD, which is grounded in matrix math and has much less to do with classical stats. Overall, it is helpful for data scientists to have breadth and depth in their knowledge of mathematics.</p>
</div>
<div id="computing-and-software-engineer-skills" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1.2</span> Computing and Software Engineer Skills</h4>
<p>Data is now collected, stored and processed with computer. With the increasing of data quantity, as termed as, we are enter the big data era. The conventional way of processing data facing unprecedented challenge. The personal computer may be not adequate to handle big data. Distributed storage, clouds computing and computer clusters become commonly-used platforms for data access and controls. Basic computing environment configuration and settings are common skills need to handle data.</p>
<p>The data processing tools and languages like R or Python, and a database querying language like SQL are the common used languages in data process and data analyzing. It is also important to have a strong software engineering knowledge so it can be comfortable to handle a large amount of data logging, and to develop data-driven products.</p>
<p>Data scientists need utilizing new technology in order to wrangle enormous data sets and work with complex algorithms, and to code or prototype quick solutions, as well as interact and integrate with complex data systems. Core languages associated with data science include SQL, Python, R, and SAS. On the periphery are Java, Scala, Julia, and others. But it is not just knowing language fundamentals. A data scientist is a technical ninja, able to creatively navigate their way through technical challenges in order to make their code work.</p>
<p>Along these lines, a data science is a solid algorithmic thinker, having the ability to break down messy problems and recompose them in ways that are solvable. This is critical because data scientists operate within a lot of algorithmic complexity. They need to have a strong mental comprehension of high-dimensional data and tricky data control flows. Full clarity on how all the pieces come together to form a cohesive solution.</p>
</div>
<div id="strong-business-acumen" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1.3</span> Strong Business Acumen</h4>
<p>It is important for a data scientist to be a tactical business consultant, an operation narrator and story teller. Working so closely with data, data scientists are positioned to learn from data in ways no one else can. They can understand the language the data speak and listen the story the data tells. That creates the responsibility to translate observations, discovery to shared knowledge, and contribute to strategy on how to solve core business problems. This means a core competency of data science is using data to cogently tell a story. No data present a cohesive narrative of problem and solution, using data insights as supporting pillars, that lead to guidance.</p>
<p>Having this business acumen is just as important as having acumen for technology and math and algorithms. There needs to be clear alignment between data science projects and business goals. Ultimately, the value doesn’t come from data, math, and tech itself. It comes from leveraging all of the above to build valuable capabilities and have strong business influence.</p>

<div id="how-to-become-a-data-scientist" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> How to Become a Data Scientist?</h3>
<p>Many people start to Position themselves for a career in data science. Not only for good job opportunities, but also for excitement of work in the technology field with freedom for experimentation and creativity. To get to this position you need solid foundations.</p>
<p>A conventional way of becoming a data scientist is Choosing a university that offers a data science degree. Or register yourself for courses that in data science and analytics fields. If you cannot do these, the option left to you is to learn by yourself.</p>
<p>The knowledge and skills you should have are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Statistics and machine learning</strong>. A good understanding of statistics is vital as a data scientist. You should be familiar with statistical tests, distributions, maximum likelihood estimators, etc. Statistics knowledge will also help you understand when different techniques are (or aren’t) a valid approach. Machine learning (ML) is a good weapon when you involve a big data project. Algorithms is the core of machine learning, although many implementations with R or Python libraries do exist and convenient to use, It is still needed a thorough understand how the algorithms works and when when it is appropriate to use different ones.</li>
<li><strong>Coding languages such as R or Python</strong>. It is essential, a data scientist is competent with a number of computing and data querying languages like R, Python and SQL.</li>
<li><strong>Databases such as MySQL and Postgres</strong>. Data is generally stored in a Database. it is important to have necessary skills for data access and control from a DBMS systems. The most commonly used DBMS systems are MySql (<a href="https://www.mysql.com/" class="uri">https://www.mysql.com/</a>) and Postgres (<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" class="uri">https://www.postgresql.org/</a>) in addition to ACCESS and EXCEL.</li>
<li><strong>Visualization and reporting technologies</strong>. Visualizing and communicating data is incredibly important, especially with companies that are making data-driven decisions, or companies where data scientists are viewed as people who help others make data-driven decisions. When it comes to communicating, this means describing your findings, or the way techniques work to audiences, both technical and non-technical. Visualization can be immensely helpful. Therefore familiar with data visualization tools like matplotlib, ggplot, or d3.js. Tableau and dashboarding have become a popular data visualization tools. It is important to not just be familiar with the tools necessary to visualize data, but also the principles behind visually encoding data and communicating information.</li>
<li><strong>Big data platforms like Hadoop</strong>.(<a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/" class="uri">https://hadoop.apache.org/</a>) and <strong>Spark</strong> (<a href="https://spark.apache.org/" class="uri">https://spark.apache.org/</a>). Although a lot of Data Science project can be tried, or at least prototyped on PC or workstations, it is reality that most large data analyzing is done on advanced computing platforms like distributed infrastructure or computer clusters. these advanced platform mostly deploy Hadoop ecosystems.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t want to learn these skills on your own, take an online course or enroll in a bootcamp. Like what you do now. It not only provides you opportunity to gain knowledge quickly but also provides you chance of networking with other people who has the similar situation like you do. Connect with other people can lead you into an online community. They all will help you gain fine gran and insider knowledge of solving problems.</p>

The path is important which can be shorter or longer, or direct and smooth, or curvy and bumpy. It is vital to follow a short and smooth path. This path is the data science project process. Figure @ref(fig:process) is the 6 steps process, which is inspired by the CRISP (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) <span class="citation">(Pete Chapman and Wirth <a href="#ref-Chapman2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">(Shearer <a href="#ref-Shearer2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>)</span> and KDD (knowledge discovery in data bases) process <span class="citation">(Li <a href="#ref-Li2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>.</p>

</p>
</div>
<div id="step1" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Step 1: Understand the Problem - Define Objectives</h3>
<p>Any data analysis must begin with business issues. With business issues a number of questions should be asked. These questions have to be the right questions and measurable, clear and concise. Define analysis question is regarded as define a Data Requirements engineering and to get a a data project specification. It starts from a business issue and asking relevant questions, only after you fully understand the problem and the issues you may be able to turn practical problem into analytical questions.</p>
<p>For example, start with a business issue: A contractor is experiencing rising costs and is no longer able to submit competitive contract proposals. One of many questions to solve this business problem might include: Can the company reduce its staff without compromising quality? Or, can company find alternative suppler on the production chain?</p>
<p>Once you have questions, you can start to thinking about data required for analysis. The data required for analysis is based on questions. The data necessary as inputs to the analysis can then be identified (e.g., Staff skills and performance). Specific variables regarding a staff member (e.g., Age and Income) may be specified and obtained. Data type can be defined as numerical or categorical.</p>
<p>After you defined you analytical questions. It is important to Set Clear evaluation of your project to measurement how success of your project.</p>
<p>This generally breaks down into two sub-steps: A) Decide what to measure, and B) Decide how to measure it.</p>
<p><strong>A) What To Measure?</strong></p>
<p>Using the contractor example, consider what kind of data you’d need to answer your key question. In this case, you would need to know the number and cost of current staff and the percentage of time they spend on necessary business functions. This is what is called in business as KPI - Key performance indicators. In answering this question, you likely need to answer many sub-questions (e.g., Are staff currently under-utilized? If so, what process improvements would help?). Finally, in your decision on what to measure, be sure to include any reasonable objections any stakeholders might have (e.g., If staff are reduced, how would the company respond to surges in demand?).</p>
<p><strong>B) How To Measure? </strong></p>
<p>Thinking about how you measure the success fo your data science project, the deep end is to measure some key performance indicators. They are the data you have chosen to use in the previous step. So measure your data is just as important, especially before the data collection phase, because your measuring process either backs up or discredits your project later on. Key questions to ask for this step include:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your time frame? (e.g., annual versus quarterly costs)</li>
<li>What is your unit of measure? (e.g., USD versus Euro)</li>
<li>What factors should be included? (e.g., just annual salary versus annual salary plus cost of staff benefits)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="step2" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Step 2: Undertand Data</h3>
<p>The second step is understand data. It includes <strong>Data collection</strong> and <strong>Data Validation</strong>. With problem understood and analytical questions defined and your validation criteria and measurements set, It is time to collect data.</p>
<div id="data-collection" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Data Collection</h4>
<p>Before collect data, the data source has to be determined based on the relevance. Variety of data source may be assessed and accessed to get relevant data. These data source may include an existing databases, or organization’s file system, or a third party service or even open web sources. They could provide redundant, or complementary, sometimes conflict data. it has to be cautious to select right data source from the very beginning. sometimes you need gather data via observation or interviews, then develop an interview template ahead of time to ensure consistency. it is a good idea to Keep your collected data organized in a log with collection dates and add any source notes as you go (including any data normalization performed). This practice validates your data and any conclusions down the road.</p>
<p>Data Collection is the actual process of gathering data on targeted variables identified as data requirements. The emphasis is on ensuring correct and accurate data collection, which means correct procedure was taken and appropriate measurements were adopted. the maximum efforts were spent to ensure the data quality. Remember that data Collection provides both a baseline to measure and a target to improve for a successful data science project.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-validation" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Data Validation</h4>
<p>Data validation id the process to Assess data quality. It is to ensure the collected data have reached quality requirements identified in the step 1, that is, they are useful and correct. The usefulness is the most important aspect. Regardless how accurate your data collections can be, if it is not useful, anything follows are just waste. It is hard to define the usefulness. depends on the problem at hand and the requirements for the find al delivery. The usefulness can various from a strong correlation between the raw data and the expected outcomes, to direct prediction power from the raw data to the concequence variables. Gernrally data validation can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data type validation</li>
<li>Range and constraint validation</li>
<li>Code and cross-reference validation</li>
<li>Structured validation</li>
<li>Consistency validation</li>
<li>Relevancy validation</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="preprocess" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Step 3: Data Preprocess</h3>
<p>Data preprocess is step that takes data processing method and technique to transforms raw data into a formatted and understandable form and ready for analyzing. Real world data is often incomplete, inconsistent, and is likely to contain many errors. Data preprocess is a proven method of resolving such issues. Tasks of data preprocess may include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Data cleaning</strong>. The process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from a record set, table, or database. It normally includes identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or irrelevant data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting the dirty or coarse data. After cleansing, a data set should be consistent with other data sets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data editing</strong>. The process involves changing and adjusting of collected data. The purpose is to ensure the quality of the collected data. Data editing should be done by fully understand the data collected and the data requirement specification. Editing data without them can be disastrous.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data reduction</strong>. The process and methods used to reduce data quantity to fit for analyzing. Raw data set collected or selected for analysis can be huge, then it could drastically slow down the analysis process. Reducing the size of the data set without jeopardizing the data analysis results is often desired. It includes records’ number reduction and data attributes reduction. Methods used for reduce data records size includes <strong>Sampling</strong> and <strong>Modelings</strong> (e.g., regression or log-linear models or histograms, clusters, etc). Methods used for attributes reduction include <strong>Feature selection</strong> and <strong>Dimension reduction</strong>. Feature selection means removal of irrelevant and redundant features. such operation should not lose information the data set has. Data analysis algorithms work better if the dimensionality, which is the number of attributes in a data object is low. Data compression techniques (e.g., wavelet transforms and principal components analysis), attribute subset selection (e.g., removing irrelevant attributes as discussed in previous paragraph), and attribute construction (e.g., where a small set of more useful attributes is derived from the large numbers of attributes in the original data set) are useful techniques.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data transformation</strong> sometimes referred to as <strong>data munging</strong> or <strong>data wrangling</strong>. It is the process of transforming and mapping data from one data form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for downstream analytics. It is often that data analysis method requires data to be analyzed have certain format or possesses certain attributes. For example, classification algorithms require that the data be in the form of categorical (nominal) attributes; algorithms that find association patterns require that the data be in the form of binary attributes. Thus, it is often necessary to transform a continuous attribute into a categorical attribute, which is called <strong>Discretization</strong>, and both continuous and discrete attributes may need to be transformed into one or more binary attributes, whci iscalled <strong>Banalization</strong>. Other methods include <strong>SCaling</strong> and <strong>normalization</strong>.Scaling changes the bounds of the data, and can be useful, for example, when you are working with data in different units. Normalization scales data sets to a smaller range such as [0.0, 1.0].</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data re-engineering</strong>
Re-engineering data is necessary when raw data come from many different data sources and in different format. Data re-engineering similar with data transformation can be done in both record level and in attributes level. Record level re-engineering is also called data <strong>Integration</strong>, which integrates variety of data into one file or place and in one format for analysis. for predictive analysis with a model, data re-enginering is also including split a given data set into two subsets called “Training” and “Test” Set.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="analyse" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Step 4: Analyze Data</h3>
<p>After your collected data being preprocessed and suitable for analysis. Now you can drill down and attempt to answer your question from <a href="#step1">Step 1</a> with the actions called Data Analyzing. It is the core activity in data science project process by writing, executing, and refining computer programs that utilize some analytical methods and algorithms to obtain insights from data sets. The methods in data analysis can be categorized into three major groups: <strong>Descriptive data analysis (DDA)</strong>, <strong>Exploratory data analysis (EDA)</strong> and <strong>Predictive data analysis (PDA)</strong>. DDA and EDA uses quantitative and statistical methods on data sets and data attributes measurements and their value distributions while DDA focus on numeric summary but EDA emphasis on graphical (plot) means. PDA on other hand may involve modeling and machine learning. Data analyzing is generally starting from Descriptive analysis, and goes further with Exploratory analysis. The most advanced methods are predictive analysis and machine learning. The later is built based on the results form the former methods. Some times mixed methods work better.</p>
<div id="descriptive-data-analysis" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4><strong>Descriptive data analysis</strong></h4>
<p>It is the simplest type of analysis. It describes and summarizes a data set quantitatively. Descriptive analysis generally starts with an univariate analysis, meaning describing a single variable (can also be called attribute, column or field) of the data. The appropriate depends on the level of measurement. For nominal variables, a frequency table and a listing of the modes are sufficient. For ordinal variables the median can be calculated as a measure of central tendency and the range (and variations of it) as a measure of dispersion. For interval level variables, the arithmetic mean (average) and standard deviation are added to the toolbox and, for ratio level variables, we could add the geometric mean and harmonic mean as measures of central tendency and the coefficient of variation as a measure of dispersion. However, there are many other possible statistics which covers areas such as location (“middle” of the data), dispersion (range or spread of data) and shape of the distribution. Moving up to two variables, descriptive analysis can involve measures of association such as computing a correlation coefficient or covariance. Descriptive analysis’ goal is to describe the key features of the sample numerically. It should shed light on the key numbers that summarize distributions within the data, may describe or show the relationships among variables with metrics that describe association, or by tables that cross tabulation counts. Descriptive analysis is typically the first step on the data analysis ladder, which only tries to get a sense of the data.</p>
</div>
<div id="explorative-data-analysis" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4><strong>Explorative data analysis</strong></h4>
<p>Descriptive analysis is very important. However, numerical summaries can only get you so far. One problem is that it can only converting a large number of values down to a few summary numbers. Unsurprisingly, different samples with different distributions, shapes, and properties can result in the same summary statistics. This will cause problems. When you are looking a simple single summary statistic, the mean of a single variable, there can be a lot of possible “solutions” or samples. The typical example is Anscombe’s quartet <span class="citation">(Anscombe <a href="#ref-Anscombe1973" role="doc-biblioref">1973</a>)</span>, it comprises four datasets that have nearly identical simple statistical properties, yet appear very different when graphed. Most kinds of statistical calculations rest on assumptions about the behavior of the data. Those assumptions may be false, and then the calculations may be misleading. We ought always to try and check whether the assumptions are reasonably correct; and if they are wrong we ought to be able to perceive in what ways they are wrong. Graphs are very valuable for these purposes.</p>
<p>EDA allows us to challenge or confirm our assumptions about the data. It is a good tool to be used in <a href="#preprocess">data prerpocess</a>. We often have pretty good expectations of what unclean data might look like, such as outliers, missing data, and other anomalies, perhaps more so than our expectations of what clean data might look like. With the more we understood data, we could develop our intuition of what factors and possible relations at are play. EDA, with its broad suite of ways to view the data points and relationships, provides us a range of lenses with which to study story that data is telling us. That in turn, helps us to come up with new hypotheses of what might be happening. Further, if we understood which variables we can control, which levers we have to work within a system to drive the metrics such as business revenue or customer conversion in the desired direction. EDA can also highlight gaps in our knowledge and which experiments might make sense to run to fill in those gaps.</p>
<p>The basic tools of EDA are plots, graphs and summary statistics. Generally speaking, it’s a method of systematically going through the data, plotting distributions of all variables (using box plots), plotting time series of data, transforming variables, looking at all pairwise relationships between variables using scatterplot matrices, and generating summary statistics for all of them or identifying outliers.</p>
</div>
<div id="predictive" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4><strong>Predictive data analysis </strong></h4>
<p>Predictive analysis builds upon <strong>inferential analysis</strong>, which is to learn about relationships among variables from an existing training data set and develop a model that can predict values of attributes for new, incomplete, or future data points. Inferential analysis is a type of analysis that from a dataset sample in hand infer some information, which might be parameters, distributions, or relationships about the broader population from which the sample came. We typically infer metrics about the population from a sample because data collection is too expensive, impractical, or even impossible to obtain all data. The typical process of inferential analysis includes testing hypothesis and deriving estimates.
There are a whole slew of approaches and tools in predictive analysis. <strong>Regression</strong> is the broadest family of tools. Within that, however, are a number of variants (lasso, ridge, robust etc.) to deal with different characteristics of the data. Of particular interest and power is <strong>Logistic Regression</strong> that can be used to predict classes. For instance, spam/not spam used to be mostly predicted with a <strong>Naïve Bayes predictor</strong> but nowadays logistic regression is more common. Other techniques and what come under the term <strong>Machine Learning</strong> include neural networks, tree-based approaches such as classification and regression trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and k-nearest neighbours.</p>

<div id="step-5-results-interpretation-and-evaluation" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Step 5: Results Interpretation and Evaluation</h3>
<p>After analyzing your data and get some answers about your original questions, it is possible that you need conduct further research and more analysis. Let us suppose that you are happy with the analysis results you have. It is finally time to interpret your results. As you interpret your analysis, keep in mind that you cannot ever prove a hypothesis true: rather, you can only fail to reject the hypothesis. Meaning that no matter how much data you collect, chance could always interfere with your results. Interpreting the results of analysis, you should thinking of how close the results address the original problems by asking yourself these key questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the data answer your original question? How?</li>
<li>Does the data help you defend against any objections? How?</li>
<li>Are there any limitation on your conclusions, any angles you haven’t considered?</li>
</ul>
<p>If your interpretation of the data holds up under all of these questions and considerations, then you likely have come to a productive conclusion. However, there could be a chance that you may find you might need to revise your original question or collect more data and you may need to roll the ball from the starting line. Again. Either way, this initial analysis of trends, correlations, variations and outliers are not completely wasted. They help you focus your data analysis on better answering your question and any objections others might have. That is the next step report and communication.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-6-data-report-and-communication" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Step 6: Data Report and Communication)</h3>
<p>Whereas the analysis phase involves programming and run programs on different computer platforms, the reporting involves narrative the results of analysis, thinking how close the results address the original problems and communicating about the outputs of analyses with interesting parties in many cases in visual formats.
During this step, data analysis tools and software are helpful but visual tools are intuitive and worth a lot of words. Visio, tableau (<a href="https://www.tableau.com/" class="uri">https://www.tableau.com/</a>), Minitab (<a href="https://www.minitab.com/" class="uri">https://www.minitab.com/</a>) and Stata are all good software packages for advanced statistical data analysis. There are also plenty of open source data visualization tools available.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the above 6 steps process is not a linear process. Any discovery of useful relationships and valuable patterns are enabled by a set of iterative activities. Iteration can occur in a single step or in a few steps in any point in the process.</p>

<div id="tools-used-in-doing-a-data-science-project" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Tools used in Doing a Data Science Project</h2>
<p>Data Scientists use traditional statistical methodologies that form the core backbone of Machine Learning algorithms. They also use Deep Learning algorithms to generate robust predictions. Data Scientists use the following tools and programming languages:</p>
<div id="r" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>R</h3>
<p>R (<a href="https://www.r-project.org/" class="uri">https://www.r-project.org/</a>) is a scripting language that is specifically tailored for statistical computing and data. It is widely used for data analysis, statistical modeling, time-series forecasting, clustering etc. R is mostly used for statistical operations. It also possesses the features of an object-oriented programming language. R is an interpreter based language and is widely popular across multiple industries particularly for doing data Science projects.</p>
</div>
<div id="python" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Python</h3>
<p>Like R, Python (<a href="https://www.python.org/" class="uri">https://www.python.org/</a>) is an interpreter based high-level programming language. Python is a versatile language. It is mostly used for Data Science and Software Development. Python has gained popularity due to its ease of use and code readability. As a result, Python is widely used for Data Analysis, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision. Python comes with various graphical and statistical packages like Matplotlib, Numpy, SciPy and more advanced packages for Deep Learning such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras etc. For the purpose of data mining, wrangling, visualizations and developing predictive models, we utilize Python. This makes Python a very flexible programming language.</p>
</div>
<div id="sql" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>SQL</h3>
<p>SQL stands for Structured Query Language. Data Scientists use SQL for managing and querying data stored in databases. Being able to extract data from databases is the first step towards analyzing the data. Relational Databases are a collection of data organized in tables. We use SQL for extracting, managing and manipulating the data. For example, A Data Scientist working in the banking industry uses SQL for extracting information of customers. While Relational Databases use SQL, <strong>NoSQL</strong> is a popular choice for non-relational or distributed databases. Recently NoSQL has been gaining popularity due to its flexible scalability, dynamic design, and open source nature. MongoDB, Redis, and Cassandra are some of the popular NoSQL databases.</p>
</div>
<div id="hadoop" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Hadoop</h3>
<p>Big data is another trending term that deals with management and storage of huge amount of data. Data is either structured or unstructured. A Data Scientist must have a familiarity with complex data and must know tools that regulate the storage of massive datasets. One such tool is Hadoop (<a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/" class="uri">https://hadoop.apache.org/</a>). While being open-source software, Hadoop utilizes a distributed storage system using a model called <strong>MapReduce</strong>. There are several other packages in Hadoop together formed a Apache ecosystem, such as Apache Pig, Hive, HBase etc. Due to its ability to process colossal data quickly, its scalable architecture and low-cost deployment, Hadoop has grown to become the most popular software for Big Data.</p>
</div>
<div id="tableau" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Tableau</h3>
<p>Tableau (<a href="https://www.tableau.com/" class="uri">https://www.tableau.com/</a>) is a Data Visualization software specializing in graphical analysis of data. It allows its users to create interactive visualizations and dashboards. This makes Tableau an ideal choice for showing various trends and insights of the data in the form of interactable charts such as Treemaps, Histograms, Box plots etc. An important feature of Tableau is its ability to connect with spreadsheets, relational databases, and cloud platforms. This allows Tableau to process data directly, making it easier for the users.</p>

</ol>
<p>Analytics and machine learning – how it ties to data science
There are a slew of terms closely related to data science that we hope to add some clarity around.</p>
<p>What is Analytics?
Analytics has risen quickly in popular business lingo over the past several years; the term is used loosely, but generally meant to describe critical thinking that is quantitative in nature. Technically, analytics is the “science of analysis” — put another way, the practice of analyzing information to make decisions.</p>
<p>Is “analytics” the same thing as data science? Depends on context. Sometimes it is synonymous with the definition of data science that we have described, and sometimes it represents something else. A data scientist using raw data to build a predictive algorithm falls into the scope of analytics. At the same time, a non-technical business user interpreting pre-built dashboard reports (e.g. GA) is also in the realm of analytics, but does not cross into the skill set needed in data science. Analytics has come to have fairly broad meaning. At the end of the day, as long as you understand beyond the buzzword level, the exact semantics don’t matter much.</p>
<p>What is the difference between an analyst and a data scientist?
“Analyst” is somewhat of an ambiguous job title that can represent many different types of roles (data analyst, marketing analyst, operations analyst, financial analyst, etc). What does this mean in comparison to data scientist?</p>
<p>Data Scientist: Specialty role with abilities in math, technology, and business acumen. Data scientists work at the raw database level to derive insights and build data product.
Analyst: This can mean a lot of things. Common thread is that analysts look at data to try to gain insights. Analysts may interact with data at both the database level or the summarized report level.
Thus, “analyst” and “data scientist” is not exactly synonymous, but also not mutually exclusive. Here is our interpretation of how these job titles map to skills and scope of responsibilities:</p>
<p>What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is a term closely associated with data science. It refers to a broad class of methods that revolve around data modeling to (1) algorithmically make predictions, and (2) algorithmically decipher patterns in data.</p>
<p>Machine learning for making predictions — Core concept is to use tagged data to train predictive models. Tagged data means observations where ground truth is already known. Training models means automatically characterizing tagged data in ways to predict tags for unknown data points. E.g. a credit card fraud detection model can be trained using a historical record of tagged fraud purchases. The resultant model estimates the likelihood that any new purchase is fraudulent. Common methods for training models range from basic regressions to complex neural nets. All follow the same paradigm known as supervised learning.
Machine learning for pattern discovery — Another modeling paradigm known as unsupervised learning tries to surface underlying patterns and associations in data when no existing ground truth is known (i.e. no observations are tagged). Within this broad category of methods, the most commonly used are clustering techniques, which algorithmically detect what are the natural groupings that exist in a data set. For example, clustering can be used to programmatically learn the natural customer segments in a company’s user base. Other unsupervised methods for mining underlying characteristics include: principal component analysis, hidden markov models, topic models, and more.
Not all machine learning methods fit neatly into the above two categories. For example, collaborative filtering is a type of recommendations algorithm with elements related to both supervised and unsupervised learning. Contextual bandits are a twist on supervised learning where predictions get adaptively modified on-the-fly using live feedback.</p>
<p>This wide-ranging breadth of machine learning techniques comprise an important part of the data science toolbox. It is up to the data scientist to figure out which tool to use in different circumstances (as well as how to use the tool correctly) in order to solve analytically open-ended problems.</p>
<p>What is Data Munging?
Raw data can be unstructured and messy, with information coming from disparate data sources, mismatched or missing records, and a slew of other tricky issues. Data munging is a term to describe the data wrangling to bring together data into cohesive views, as well as the janitorial work of cleaning up data so that it is polished and ready for downstream usage. This requires good pattern-recognition sense and clever hacking skills to merge and transform masses of database-level information. If not properly done, dirty data can obfuscate the ‘truth’ hidden in the data set and completely mislead results. Thus, any data scientist must be skillful and nimble at data munging in order to have accurate, usable data before applying more sophisticated analytical tactics.</p>

<p>Since this book is “Do Data Science”. It means learn data science by doing. First of all we need to get our weaponry or tools ready.</p>
<p>We already knew that there are a list of tools used by data scientists. Apart from the personal preference, the most used tool is R. This book will use R as the tools to do a complete data science project. However this is not a R language book, it will not teach you about R language and how to use it. It will simply demonstrate a data science project completion step by step, which is completed with R language.</p>
<p>By doing, I mean that you can simply mimic what I have done and follow along by typing or copy past my code into your working space, observe the effects and the results of each line of code execution. Thinking of why I have to do this and what results can I expect along the line of data science project’s process. monitoring the issue raised and the methods used to resolve the issues.

<div id="r-scripts" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> R Scripts</h3>
<p>R is the primary statistical programming language for performing modeling and graphical tasks. so it can run in command line as an interpreting languages. However, With its extensive support for performing increasingly complex computations such as manipulations on matrix and dataframes, R is now mostly running in script for a variety of tasks that involve complex datasets with complex operations.</p>
<p>There is plenty of editing tools which perform interactions with the native R console. With any one of them you can edit and run R script. You can also simply import extra packages and use the provided functions to achieve results with minimal number lines of code. There are several editors and IDEs that facilitate GUI features for authoring and executing R scripts. Some of the useful editors that support the R programming language are: RGui (R Graphical User Interface) and RStudio, a integrated R script development environment.</p>
<p>This book will NOT teach you how to code in R. Learning R and to code in R language is not so hard. It just requires a lot of trials and time-spending. You can always going online and searching on Google, Baidu or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a>. There are also plenty of examples and code. The chances are if you’re trying to figure out how to do something in R, other people have tried as well, so rather than banging your head against the wall, look online. There are also some books available to help you out on this front as well. I suggest looking other people’s code and run it to see the results. R manual is always handy and is available in <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html">here</a> .</p>

<h4>Pane 3: Console Pane</h4>
<p>By default console pane appears at the bottom left. Console pane is the most important pane – the Console! This is where you enter your commands to be executed or your R code to do everything in the curriculum. The rest of the document will be largely concerned with working in the Console, with occasional references to other panes.
By default it also has 4 tabs: <strong>Console</strong>, <strong>Terminal</strong>, <strong>R markdown</strong> and <strong>Jobs</strong>. Apart from console, Other three, as their name suggested, they are the interface between you and other systems. Terminal is the interface between you and operating system, where you can have a direct interaction with OS, in our case it is the Windows. R markdown<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> is interface between you and the markdown compiler, if authoring a markdown file, every time you compile (knitr<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>) the code, system will report status in that window. Jobs is th interface between you and your job execution system. it is generally running on a remote server.
Basically Console pane is the communication interface between you and systems. The information appears here are generally important if any proble,m occurs.</p>

<div id="pane-4-multifunction-pane" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Pane 4: Multifunction Pane</h4>
<p>The multifunction pane appears by default at the bottom right. It has many tabs. By default it opens the <strong>Files</strong> tab. My version it has <strong>File</strong>, <strong>Plots</strong>, <strong>Package</strong>, <strong>Help</strong> and <strong>Viewer</strong> tabs.</p>
<div id="files-tab" class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5><strong>Files tab</strong></h5>
<p>This tab works like your file explorer. It shows you all the files you have in your RStudio account (your document in windows). The buttons underneath the tab allow you to do operations on the files like create a new folder, delete files. rename files and many more functions. which you normally do on file system.</p>
</div>
<div id="plots" class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5><strong>Plots</strong></h5>
<p>When you run code in the Console pane that creates a plot, the plots tab will be automatically selected and the result of the plot generated will be displayed. See Figure @ref(fig:plot))</p>

</div>
<div id="packages" class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5><strong>Packages</strong></h5>
<p>This tab allows you to see the list of all the packages (add-ons to the R code) you have access to, and which are loaded in already. You can also check packages in your system (installed) and the version of them.</p>
</div>
<div id="help" class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5><strong>Help</strong></h5>
<p>This tab will be automatically selected whenever you run help code in the Console, by type in console <code>? function</code>or type in script <code>help(function)</code>. It is very useful for beginner to get quick reference on any function or command you are not sure of. here is an example of asking help with <code>plot</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>help(plot)</code></pre>
<p>You can access it at any time by clicking on the tab “Help” to see what the “Help” tab can offer. See Figure @ref(fig:help),</p>

</div>
<div id="viewer" class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5><strong>Viewer</strong></h5>
<p>Viewer tab in the multifunction pane is designed for view or display R markdown  results. If you are authoring a R notebook<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> or any Markdown file, your Knit results can be viewed by select “Preview in Viewer Pane”. once this selection is made, you will see the notebook or your Markdown document will be displayed in the Viewer window and you will notice that the Viewer tab is automatically selected and the viewer window is also maximized.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Bootsup your RStudio</h2>
<p>Once you boots up your RStudio, you are ready to kick off your R coding. However, the first thing you may want to do is to set up your working directory. This will change the default location for all file input and output that you will do in the current session.</p>
<p>RStudio makes this easy, simply click “Session -&gt; Set Working Directory -&gt; Choose Directory…”. See figure Figure @ref(fig:setwk) below,</p>

<p>Then you need to navigate to where you want your project to be sit. For example, in my case I used “D:/Teach2020/short course/Data analysis - prediction with Rstudio/IntroToDataScience-master”, it is silly to be so long, you can certainly set up for a shorter one. Anyway, the point is choose your won directory and remember it. If you tried it, you should notice that once you have chosen a directory, A command appeared in the Console pane and this is the command R executes when you set your working directory from the session menu. To achieve the same result you normally would have typed this manually in the console. See Figure @ref(fig:setwkc) below,</p>

<p>Type command or instructions on command line at Console is what the general data scientists do when they try to analysis some data or prove some ideas. You can complete this tutorial at the command line in Console pane. I would suggest you, instead, creating a script to save all your hard work. This way you can easily reproduce the results or make changes without retyping everything.</p>
<p>To do so, you need to create a new file by click the “File -&gt;New file”, and select “R Script”. See Figure @ref(fig:newrfile),</p>

<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>Exercises at the end of each chapter, are provided for you to periodically explore alternatives of a solution or to enhance some key techniques. It is always good if you can do the exercises.</p>
<p>The default protocol is that I have some codes written and you will down load them and open in your RStudio. Then you need to type (or copy and past line by line into your file. you can run them and understand their functions and the reason to function like that. After you understand them you can change them or write some new code. While you are doing that, you simply comment out my code rather than delete them just in case you need to come back to look at them again. Once you can write your own code, it shows you have learned.</p>

<p>The sinking of the RMS Titanic occurred on the night of 14 April 1912 in the North Atlantic Ocean, four days into the ship’s maiden voyage from Southampton, UK to New York City, USA. The largest passenger liner in service at the time, Titanic had an estimated 2,224 people on board when she struck an iceberg at around 23:40 (ship’s time) on Sunday, 14 April 1912. Her sinking two hours and forty minutes later at 02:20 (05:18 GMT) on Monday, 15 April resulted in the deaths of more than 1,500 people, which made it one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history.</p>
<p>Later, in 1997 American file director James Cameron turned this disastrous and tragic event into an epic romance film. The film star’s Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet outstanding performance in the file makes it a best selling movie in the year.</p>

<p>Kaggle (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/" class="uri">https://www.kaggle.com/</a>), a subsidiary of Google LLC, is the world’s largest data science community with powerful tools and resources to help you achieve your data science goals. Kaggle was founded in 2010 with the idea that data scientists need a place to come together and collaborate on projects, learning new techniques and share each others experience. This has transformed into a network with more than 1,000,000 registered users, and has created a safe place for data science learning, sharing, and competition.</p>
<p>Using the human competitive spirit, Kaggle created a platform for organizations to host competitions which have fueled new methodology and techniques in data science, and given organizations new insights from the data they provided.</p>

<p>Generally, Each competition has a host, and each host has to prepare and provide data. When providing data, the host has the opportunity to give additional information such as a description, evaluation method, timeline, and prize for winning. Although this may not be an ideal real world data problem, which data scientist may face in the business. But it provides a good starting point for learners. In a real world, you may need to start from understand the business and find data sources by your self. Although competition host has provided data. You cannot assume the data provided are clean data and ready for analysis. Cleaning and preprocess data are part of the competition.

<li>It is well studied, so there are plenty of alternative training materials available for your reference.</li>
<li>Lastly, the problem itself is interesting one that has a characteristic of only has a better solution and no best solution. So people are still working in it and uses the latest technologies.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="the-titanic-problem" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> The Titanic problem</h2>
<p>The objective of the Titanic problem defined on the Kaggle website as stated in the following:</p>
<p>"The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.</p>
<p>On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.</p>
<p>While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.</p>
<p>In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (i.e. name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc/)."</p>
<div id="the-challenge" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>The challenge</h3>
<p>The competition is simple: we want you to <strong>use the Titanic passenger data</strong> (name, age, price of ticket, etc) to try to <strong>predict who will survive and who will die</strong>.</p>
<p>The requirement is to predict passengers’ <strong>survive</strong>. Like many other real data science problems, <a href="#predictive">Prediction</a> is to build a model which takes input data and produce an output. A prediction model is a mathematical formula that takes input from historical facts reflecting past event and produce a output that to make predictions about future or otherwise unknown events. A simple way to understand model is to think a model in the following three ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The relationship between input and output can be expressed by some kinds of math formula. It is generally called definable model, the math formula can be as simple as a function of Polynomial expression or as complected as a regression model, or other statistics models.</li>
<li>Some models can not be explicitly expressed with a math formula, instead they are expressed in rules. those are rule-based models.</li>
<li>Other models can not be expressed in a math formula nor in rules. The solution is build a neural networks to do prediction. An Neural Networks can be regard as a “black box”, which takes input and produce output, the internal connections are transparent to users. Machine learning is more focused on models rooted in Neural networks.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any model fundamentally expresses relationships between inputs and outputs. So as part of understanding the problem, We could interpret that the Kaggle Titanic challenge is to find creditable relationships between input data and out put data (which is survive or not). Once the relationship is found, we can express using either a math formula, a set of rules or a Neural Network model.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-data" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>The data</h3>
<p>Kaggle competition usually provides competition data. There is a “Data” tab on any competition site. Click on the Data tab at the top of the competition page, you will find the raw data provided and most of time there are brief explanation of the data attributes<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> too.</p>
<p>There are three files in the Titanic Challenge:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>train.csv,</li>
<li>test.csv, and</li>
<li>gender_submission.csv.</li>
</ol>
<p>The training set is supposedly used to build your models. For the training set, it provides the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Your model will be based on attributes like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use feature engineering to create new features.</p>
<p>The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, there is no ground truth for each passenger is provided. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.</p>
<p>The data sets has also include gender_submission.csv, a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.</p>
</div>
<div id="submission" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Submission</h3>
<p>Submission at the Titanic competition is equivalent to the requirements on the final report of any data science project. that is one of the questions you need to understand in the beginning of the project.</p>
<p>Titanic competition requires the results need be submitted in the file. The file structure is demonstrated in the “gender_submission.csv”. It is also provided as an example that shows how you should structure your results, which means predictions.</p>
<p>The example submission in “Gender_submission” predicts that all female passengers survived, and all male passengers died. It is clearly biased. Your hypotheses regarding survival will probably be different, which will lead to a different submission file. Properly it is a good idea now to rename the “Gender_submission.csv” file into “My_submission.csv” now. So you know that you have to submit “my_submission.csv” as the final report of your project and the submission indicate your completion of your project.</p>

<div class="rmdaction">
<p>Do it yourself:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Download data file from Kaggel web site.(<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data" class="uri">https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data</a>)</li>
<li>Unzip it into your working directory.</li>
<li>Rename “Gender_submission.csv” file into “My_submission.csv”.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>Make sure your submission should have:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>“PassengerId” column containing the IDs of each passenger from test.csv.</li>
<li>“Survived” column (that you will create!) with a “1” for the rows where you think the passenger survived, and a “0” where you predict that the passenger died.</li>

<p>The purpose of this tutorial is to understand the process of data science project. The first step, as indicated by the 6-step process in section @ref(process), is “understand the problem”. Real world problem is far more complicated than this well defined problem. Mostly business organizations don’t know the the exact problem (that is part of reason why they want data analysis or business analysis) or they know the problem (in general) but the problem can not br expressed explicitly or in terms of data.</p>
<p>I have met a situation that a business organization has created a data center and collected all their business operational data. The boss asked to analyze these data and find:
1. Is there are problems?
2. If yes, how to overcome these problems?
3. If not, how to improve the business operations?</p>
<p>You see, here the problem is how to define the problem? how to convert business problem into data science problem.</p>
<p>For the example, the first problem in the above list needs to know what is the normal or expected performance? How to evaluate the performance? In terms of turn over or profit? In what time scale? It could be a short of profit in the moment but it not causes alarm because the recent investment for developing a new market. At a long run it will have a great ROI (Return on Investment). The second problem demands to identify the cause of the problem and the third to identify the KIP (Key performance Indicators). they are both to identify the relationships between predictor and dependent variables. But they can be completely different sets.</p>
<p>Understand problem is actually more complicated in real world. Until you have completely understood it and turned it into a list of analytical problems you can move to next step.</p>
<p>With the Titanic problem, combining the story and the requirements on the Kaggle web site, I would consider these:</p>
<ul>
<li>On April 14 and 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. The overall survival rate is 32%.</li>
<li>One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.</li>
<li>Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.</li>
<li>The story tells us that when they were get on board the lifeboats, they applied a policy of “women and children first” and also “the ship crew are the last”.</li>
<li>Sometimes the family was boarding the life boat together and some of the family members were swimming together too.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those thoughts form some kind of assumptions in mind. They will guide later data explorations.</p>

<p>Understand your building raw materials can help you choose correct tools and make the most use of them to construct your ideal buildings.</p>
<p><strong>Understand data</strong> is the foundation for solving analytical problems. The two major purposes of understand data are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Access data quantity</li>
<li>Access data quality</li>
<li>Set up objects for <strong>data preprocess</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In practice the two initial data assessments can be done together or separately. The purpose of them is to setup objective for <strong>data preprocess</strong> to accomplish. The methods used to understand data can be both Descriptive analysis and Exploratory analysis.</p>
<div id="load-data" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Load data</h2>
<p>Here are my initial plan for understand Titanic data:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Get Titanic data load into RStudio</li>
<li>Assess Data quantity (number of files, size of each file in number of records, number of attributes in each record)</li>
<li>Attributes types assessment</li>
<li>Attributes value assessment (numbers and summary, description).</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, get your RStudio ready.</p>
<p>If you have not done the Exercises 2.5, which asked you to create a new R project named “MyDataScienceProject”. You can do it now.</p>
<p>Open your RStudio, Click File-&gt; New project-&gt;New Directory -&gt; choose New R Project“, then, enter”MyDataScienceProject" in the Directory name box and select your directory. Click “Create Project” at the right bottom as shown in Figure @ref(fig:newproject)</p>

<p>Don’t panic. let us look into it.</p>
<p>The first thing I want you to learn is to use RStudio help. Remember how to use it?</p>
<p>Now type <strong><code>? read.cvs</code></strong> in your Console, look at the Multifunction pane, the tab <strong>Help</strong> is auto selected and help message for <strong><code>read.cvs</code></strong> is appeared. See Figure @ref(fig:Rhelp)</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="img/Rhelp.png" alt="Screen capture of Error and Help" width="95%" />
<p class="caption">
(#fig:Rhelp)Screen capture of Error and Help
</p>
</div>
<p>Now, notice that the error message says, “<code>cannot open file 'test.csv': No such file or directory</code>”. We don’t have file <code>train.csv</code> and <code>test.csv</code> in our working directory.</p>
<p>Now, Download the <code>traon.csv</code> and <code>test.csv</code> from Kaggle (if you did not download already) and stored into our project working directory<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Please note that it is a common practice that data scientist download datasets from data sources and save to a local drive. Having a local version of the raw datasets is good idea. But a lot of times, it is unfeasible to do so either because the data is too big or there are some access restriction prevent you have a local version. So, you have to using service provider’s API or data URI through HTTP protocol or other protocol like FTP etc.</p>
<p>Once, you have download the datasets from Kaggle website and unzipped (or moved) them into your local working directory, run the same code again by select them all and click “Run” or type “Ctr + Enter” .</p>
<p>You will see the two new attributes have been created and displayed in the <strong>WorkSpace pane</strong>. See Figure @ref(fig:importdata).</p>

<div id="assess-data-quantity" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Assess Data Quantity</h2>
<p>After we have load the raw data into our WorkSpace, we can start to explore and exam the raw data.</p>
<p>In R code, the best way to explore a dataset and get the first impression on its size (number of records and numbers of attributes) is using <code>str()</code> function. If you wan tot know more about it, as I mentioned earlier, using help by typing <code>? str()</code> in your Console. There is an equivalent R code is called <code>help &lt;statement&gt;</code>, you can try <code>help str()</code>.</p>
<p>Now let us run the following code,</p>
<pre><code># Exam train and test datasets
train &lt;- read.csv(&quot;train.csv&quot;, header = TRUE)
test &lt;- read.csv(&quot;test.csv&quot;, header = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>You will see this in your console, Figure @ref(fig:Rstr).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="img/RstrResult.png" alt="Screen capture of str(tain) and str(test)" width="130%" />
<p class="caption">
(#fig:Rstr)Screen capture of str(tain) and str(test)
</p>
</div>
<p>Firstly, you will see the size of the two datasets:</p>
<ul>
<li>train has <strong>891 records</strong> and each record has <strong>12 attributes</strong>. Okay, R uses statistics terminology, observation is record in data science term. properties of an observation are attributes of a record. Notice that train has a type of data.from. Data.frame is the most used data type in R. (Try <code>?data.frame</code> to explore)</li>
<li>test has <strong>418 records</strong> and each record has <strong>11 attributes</strong>, which are less than train’s in both number of records and attributes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dataset <code>test</code> has less number of records makes sense because any model you need large data to train and less data to test ( it will become clear later). However, why <code>test</code> has one less attribute? compare with <code>train</code>, it is easy to find out that the missing attribute is <em>Survived</em>. Do you understand now? The dataset <code>test</code> is supposedly to be used for testing our model (we will have it later) for predicting passengers’ have lived and dead. So, it should not have a value now. The entire problem is for us to come up with a value on the attribute.</p>
<p>RStudio has a conveniently build-in function to explore data size. At the <strong>WorkSpace pane</strong>, you can see the under <strong>Environment</strong> tab, the two attributes we have created are listed there. In font of each attribute there is a
<img src="img/arrow.PNG" /> sign. click it you can exam its size and structure. It is equivalent to run <code>str()</code> R instruction. You can also lick on the attribute name to explore the entire dataset.</p>

<div class="rmdaction">
<p>Try yourself:</p>
<p>At RStudio <strong>WorkSpace pane</strong>,</p>
<p>Click varaible name <code>train</code> and <code>test</code> to explore the contents of datasets.</p>

<div id="general-data-attributes-assessment" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> General Data Attributes Assessment</h2>
<p>After a brief assessment on the data quantity, we know that the both datasets are not too big in terms of both number records (891 and 418) and number of attributes (12 and 11). We also have an intuitive understanding about the attributes, some obvious names like <em>Name</em>, <em>Sex</em> and <em>Age</em>; and some not so obvious names like <em>SibSp</em> and <em>Parch</em>.</p>
<p>Before we looking into individual attributes (single variate analysis) in our datasets, let us get some general sense of all attributes and make sure we understand each of them.</p>
<p>We knew that dataset <code>test</code> has 11 attributes and <code>train</code> has 12 attributes. The one attribute short is the <em>Survived</em>. The rest are the same. Let us look into those attributes, the following is from the Kaggel web site:</p>

*Pclass*: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower

*Age*: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

*Sibsp*: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
*Sibling* = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
*Spouse* = husband, wife (mistresses and fiancés were ignored)

*Parch*: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Parent = mother, father
Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.</code></pre>
<p>Just looking into these attributes’ description, a few thoughts are occurred:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Attribute types</li>
</ol>
<p>There are attributes should be categorical types. The values of those attributes can be any types but the importance is that they can classify the records into sets of similar groups and this grouping make sense to the problem to be solved. In Titanic datasets, attributes should have <strong>categorical</strong> type are: <em>Survived</em>, <em>Sex</em>, <em>Embarked</em>, and <em>Pclass</em>.</p>
<p>Other attribute perhaps should have numerical type. Thsi is because these attributes values change from record to record. They can be the values of discrete, continuous, or timeseries. One thing in common is that these values can be manipulated and applied with many math functions and plotting tools for visualization. In Titanic datasets, attributes should have <strong>numerical</strong> type are: <em>Age</em>, <em>Fare</em>, <em>SibSp</em>, <em>Parch</em>.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Contribution to Survive</li>
</ol>
<p>The final goal is to predict passenger’s survived or not. It makes sense to assess the prediction power of each attribute. which is the contribution of an attribute to attrribute <em>Survived</em>. In other words, the potential relationships among these attributes and with the attribute <em>Survived</em> need to be assessed. Here are some thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Pclass</em> should somehow linked with <em>Fare</em> and <em>Cabin</em>. Generally, the higher the class is and the more expensive of the fare will be and the better cabin locations are. So those should have some sort of correlations among them. they together should have some affect on survive. You would think that the expensive ticket, means better cabin location and has privilege to escape first in the disaster.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the ticket number to do with survive? Is it just a random number? Or is associated with cabin? Or anything else like Port of embarkation? ticket number in some other systems could have more information rather than just an unique number.</p></li>
<li><p>Is the <em>Fair</em> in someways associated with journey length, which means the Port of embarkation and the port of disembarkation? Or cabin location and condition?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can have other thoughts too. To prove or disprove these assumptions and thoughts, we need to look into the actual datasets at least to see:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What are the data types for various attributes?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Which attributes are available in the dataset?</li>
<li>Which attributes are categorical?</li>
<li>Which attributes are numerical?</li>
<li>Which attributes are mixed data types?</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Any errors in the attributes values?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Which features may contain errors or typos?</li>
<li>Which features contain blank, null or empty values?</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions will be answered in the following two sections.</p>
</div>
<div id="actual-attributes-types-examination" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Actual Attributes Types Examination</h2>
<p>Since we have our raw data in RStudio, We can exam attributes’ types. From figure @ref(fig:Rstr), we can see that all the attributes have three types, <code>int</code>, <code>Factor</code>, <code>num</code>.</p>
<p>Attributes have <code>int</code> types are: <em>PassengerId</em>, <em>Survived</em>, <em>SibSp</em>, <em>Parch</em>.</p>
<p>Attributes has <code>Factor</code> types are: <em>Name</em>, <em>Sex</em>, <em>Ticket</em>, <em>Cabin</em> and <em>Embarked</em>.</p>
<p>Attributes has <code>num</code> types are: <em>Age</em> and <em>Fare</em>.</p>
<p>We know that, the type <code>int</code> is for attribute that has an integer value; and <code>num</code> is for an numeric attribute, which has the values of real numbers.</p>
<p>Type <code>Factor</code> is R language’s way to say category type. It is a attribute that can take on one of a limited, and usually fixed, number of possible values, such as blood type.</p>
<p>Attributes types affect the operations we can apply on that attributes. In other words inappropriate types can prevent us to do proper analysis on that attribute. For example, it doe’s not make sense to calculate average on sex, so it is better to be with a type of Category, in R is a <code>Factor</code>. Similarly, <em>Survived</em> will have only two values 0 or 1, to represent death or live. It makes sense to be an <code>Factor</code> too. Being a <code>int</code> type, it will prevent us to apply many methods that only works for a <code>Factor</code> type attribute.</p>
<p>Another example is <em>Name</em>, its original type is <em>Factor</em> to reflect on its uniqueness. However, Type “Factor” is not good for string processing. It has been prevented that to apply regular expression<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> on it. So, it is appropriate to change it into <em>chr</em> as a character.</p>
<p>There are other inappropriate or wrong attribute’s types too such as <em>SibSp</em> and <em>Parch</em> are currently typed <em>int</em>. May be they should be considered as <em>Factor</em>. It is a common practice that data scientists apply different analyses on a attribute and change the attribute type to apply other different algorithms again. The goal is to dig the insight out of data.</p>
<p>So, looking into data attributes types, compare with the original meaning of each attributes can help us to spot any inappropriate types or wrong types.</p>

<div class="rmdthinking">
<p>Thinking:</p>
<p>Is <strong>Servived typed</strong> <code>int</code> approriate?</p>
What other attributes do you think are in a wrong type?
</div>

</div>
<div id="attvalue" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Actual Data Attributes Value Examination</h2>
<p>To understand given datasets needs to carefully examine the values of each data attributes to:</p>
<ul>
<li>find any errors and missing values</li>
<li>find value distribution</li>
<li>find potential relation with the attribute to be predicted (also called dependent variable)</li>
</ul>
<p>Finding errors, typos and missing values can set up the goals for data prepsocess.</p>
<p>Since the examine covers both datesets <code>train</code> and <code>test</code>, it make sense to combine the two datasets into one big dataset, so it can save us to run the same code twice on the different datasets.</p>
<p>Copy the following code into your script,</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a><span class="co"># Add a &quot;Survived&quot; attribute to the test dataset to allow for combining with train dataset</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-3"><a href="#cb9-3"></a>test &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">data.frame</span>(test[<span class="dv">1</span>], <span class="dt">Survived =</span> <span class="kw">rep</span>(<span class="st">&quot;NA&quot;</span>, <span class="kw">nrow</span>(test)), test[ ,<span class="dv">2</span><span class="op">:</span><span class="kw">ncol</span>(test)])</span>
<span id="cb9-4"><a href="#cb9-4"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-5"><a href="#cb9-5"></a><span class="co"># Combine data sets. Append test.survived to train</span></span>
<span id="cb9-6"><a href="#cb9-6"></a>data &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">rbind</span>(train, test)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we have a dataset <code>data</code>, which combines both datasets <code>train</code> and <code>test</code> datasets. We assigned the value of attribute <em>Survived</em> in the original dataset <code>test</code> as “NA”. You can check them in the <strong>WorkSpace pane</strong> by click variable data.</p>

<div class="rmdtry">
<p>Thinking:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Can we combine <code>train</code> and <code>test</code> without add <em>Survived</em> attribute to the test? Like,</li>
</ol>
<p><code>data &lt;- rbind(train, test)</code></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Why add attibute <em>Survived</em> as the second attribute? Can we add it as the first one? Like,</li>
</ol>
<p><code>test &lt;- data.frame(Survived = rep("NA", nrow(test)), test[,])</code></p>
</div>

<p>It is good idea to have bird eye’s view on our combined dataset.</p>

<p>This summary  tell us a lot of information. Most obvious are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>PassengerID</em> is useless in terms of predicting survived or not. in addition, it is not much help that provide a statistical summary on it.</li>
<li><em>Survived</em> and <em>Pclass</em> numbers are useful and interesting.</li>
<li><em>Name</em> is mostly unique, which comes a surprise that only 2 names are repeated twice.</li>
<li><em>Gender</em> distribution among passenger is unbalanced that male overweight female.</li>
<li><em>Age</em> is interesting that minimum age 0.17 is alarming and there is 263 missing values.</li>
<li><em>SibSp</em> tells us the largest relatives travel together is 8.</li>
<li><em>ParCh</em> tells us the largest family travel together is 9.</li>
<li>There are a number of <em>ticket</em> has the same number. The most repeat number is CA. 2343, which has 11 duplicates.</li>
<li>Ticket <em>Fare</em> shows the minimum is 0, which is interesting that someone take a free ride. The maximum is over 512, which is far too expensive when the mean value is only about 33.</li>
<li><em>Cabin</em> has a large number of missing values (identified by "").</li>
<li><em>Embarked</em> only has three values which is not a good sign for prediction. it also has 2 missing value.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can see now one function can provide so much information. Quantitative summary is a great tool for a data scientist.</p>
<p>Now, Let us exam each attribute,</p>
<div id="passengerid." class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.1</span> PassengerID.</h3>
<p><em>PassengerId</em> is an identifier, So only its uniqueness and missing value are considered.</p>
<p>There are many ways you can use to find out. I simply check its total number and its unique number. If the both equal to the number of records in the dataset, it shows that there is no duplication and no missing values in the attribute.</p>
<p>So we do,</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb12"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb12-1"><a href="#cb12-1"></a><span class="co"># Exam PassengerID</span></span>

<pre><code>## [1] 1309</code></pre>
<p>The results shows the both number 1309, which is equal to the total number of records in the dataset. It proves the <em>PassengerID</em> has not missing value and duplication.</p>
</div>
<div id="survived" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.2</span> Survived</h3>
<p><em>Survived</em> is the attribute that its value will be produced by a model for the dataset <code>test</code>. It is called <strong>Consequencer</strong> in modeling contrast with other attributes. which are used to produce a prediction, are called <strong>Predictor</strong>. So, our exam will be conducted only on dataset <code>train</code>. Again we can check the numbers whether they can add up or not. As we already mentioned that it makes sense to change the <em>Servived</em> from type <code>chr</code> into <code>Factor</code>. We do,</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb16"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb16-1"><a href="#cb16-1"></a><span class="co"># Exam Survived</span></span>

<pre><code>## 
##   0   1  NA 
## 549 342 418</code></pre>
<p>The results proved that the <em>Survived</em> value has the correct numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>418 ‘NA’ values are the <em>Survived</em>’s value in the dataset <code>test</code>, and</li>
<li>the 549 death and 342 survived, together maded up the total number of dataset <code>train</code>, which is 891.</li>
</ul>
<p>So we know the value of <em>Survived</em> in the dataset <code>train</code> are correct and has no missing values. It is interesting here to think about the survive rate. How to calculate?</p>
<p>I will do this,</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb18"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb18-1"><a href="#cb18-1"></a><span class="co"># Calculate the survive rate in train data is 38% and the death rate is 61.61%</span></span>

<pre><code>## 
##         0         1 
## 0.6161616 0.3838384</code></pre>
<p>So we know the survive rate in the dataset <code>train</code> is about 61%. This is interesting because it reflects the overall survival rate.</p>
</div>
<div id="pclass" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.3</span> Pclass</h3>
<p><em>Pclass</em> is the feature which splits the passengers into three division namely class-1, class-2, class-3. As we understood it should be in type of <code>Factor</code> rather than <code>int</code>. We shall change its type first and then to see if there missing value or errors. It is also good to know the survival rate in each class. So. we can compare with the overall survival rate in the dataset <code>train</code>.</p>

<p>If you want, you can check the total of the three classes which is 1309. It equals to the total number of records in the <code>data</code> (total number fo passenger). And there is no other numbers than 1,2 and 3. So we can conclude that there is no missing value and no errors in <em>Pcalss</em>.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see the survival rate for each class,</p>

<p>Let us thinking about this numbers. Class-3 has 55.1% of passenger distribution but has 34.79% passenger survival distribution. Clearly, the survive rate in class-3 is lower than other two classes. It is equivalent to say, <strong>the survival chances of a passenger who is in class-1 are higher than who is a class-2 and class-3</strong>.</p>

<p>Numbers are good to provide summary and test some assumptions. Analyzing given data by means of statistical summary and other numbering methods is called <strong>Descriptive analysis</strong>. See section @ref(analyse) .</p>
<p>Perhaps, it is a good time to introduce <strong>Exploratory analysis</strong>, on the contrast with the Descriptive analysis, it uses graphical tools to explore the inside of given datasets.</p>
<p>To do so, we need to import some useful graphical tools provided by R community. We can then use them to plot <em>Survived</em> as an factor on <em>Pclass</em> numbers.</p>

<p>Graph is better, isn’t it? It is very intuative.</p>
<p>Let’s briefly interpret this graph. The graph shown @ref(fig:Survivalrate) tells us that the survive rate in Class-3 is the worst, and followed by class-2 and lastly, class-1. More people perished in the class-3 than any other two classes. It provides an important point that the chance of survive is associated with the <strong>social glass</strong>, if we can prove the Class-3 ticket is cheaper.</p>
<p>To sum up the analysis with Pclass, We have used both <strong>Descriptive analysis</strong> and <strong>Exploratory analysis</strong>. The results suggested that <strong>the <em>Pclass</em> has a strong relation with death rate</strong>. That is passengers in Class-3 have a higher chance of death. The correlation with social class (richer or poor) is waiting to be proved if the class-3 ticket is cheaper than others.</p>
</div>
<div id="name" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.4</span> Name</h3>
<p><em>Name</em> attribute by definition shows peoples’ name. It should not have any impact on passengers’ live and death. Never heard of someone was survived because one’s name!
However we still need to asess its quality. Fir</p>
<p>Firstly, you may notice that the type of <em>Name</em> is a <code>Factor</code>, which is contradicted with the conventional understanding that name is a string or a list characters. Type <code>chr</code> would be more appropriate. Change its type to <code>chr</code> will help us to apply character functions to it and get it contents easily. Factor shows the uniqueness. it could help us to assess if there is missing value or duplicated values.</p>
<p>Notice that attribute <em>Name</em> only has 1307 levels (can be observed from the <code>data</code> structure on the <strong>WorkSpace pane</strong>). In addition, the <code>data</code> summary, see Figure @ref(fig:summaryofdata), not only confirmed this but also identified the two shorts because of the value “Connolly, Miss. Kate” and “Kelly, Mr. James” have been repeated twice each.</p>
<p>Let us explore <em>Name</em> values in details.
Firstly, let us convert <em>Name</em> type into <code>chr</code>. Then we can check duplicated names using <code>which</code> function in R to get the duplicate names and store them into a vector <code>dup.names</code>. And echo them out.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb37"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb37-1"><a href="#cb37-1"></a><span class="co"># Convert Name type</span></span>

<p>Our code confirmed that the two duplicated names are indeed "“Kelly, Mr. James” and “Connolly, Miss. Kate”. It comes no surprise that the both names are pretty common in UK and USA.</p>
<p>One discovery though is that the names appeared has a title in it! <strong>Mr.</strong> is used in Kelly James and <strong>Miss.</strong> is used in Connolly Kate. This could be interesting. We can leave this for <strong>Preprocess</strong> to explore more. For the quality assessment it is mission accomplished.</p>
</div>
<div id="sex" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.5</span> Sex</h3>
<p><em>Sex</em> attribute value assessment is simple. Its type <code>Factor</code> helps a lot. Since it only has two values “male” and “female”, we could easily check if there are missing values and any errors.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb39"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb39-1"><a href="#cb39-1"></a><span class="co"># Use summary to check numbers and distribution</span></span>

<p>It is obvious that there is no error and missing values. The result confirms this: male 843 and female 466, together we have 1309 passengers, which is the total numbers of the passenger.</p>
<p>It is also simple to explore the relationship between gender and the survival rate. We had an assumption that the male passengers have a high death rate. We have plot tools in our disposal, let’s make use of it. Since only dataset <code>train</code> has the values on <em>Survived</em>, it makes sense that we only plot relation between gender and survival on dataset <code>train</code>.</p>

<p>The results have provided us with good evidence for access its values. Firstly, we know the minimum value is 0, and there are 891 records have 0 values.

<p>The discovery is similar again with <em>SibSp</em>, that is:
1. The minimum value is 0, and there are 1002 records have 0 values. It means that there are 1002 passenger who travel without without parents or children (we still cannot see the passenger travel alone, he or she could travel with a sibling or a sprout, However, this rise an idea to look into passenger who travel alone, which means no sibling, sprout, parents and children.);
2. The maximum number is 9. There are 2 of them.
3. Apart from the value 0, the largest company number is 1. There are 170.
4. There are totally 8 possibilities in terms of the numbers of company a passenger can have.
5. It has not error or missing value since the total number are correct.</p>
<p>We can assess its prediction power too by looking into the relationship between <em>Parch</em> and <em>Survived</em>,</p>

<p>The plot shows us that it is definitely have impact on survival. But it i snot clear the prediction power in comparison with <em>SibSp</em>. I am not sure there are difference between “travel with parents or children” and “travel with siblings and sprout”. In addition, value 0 in each attributes does not excludes other attributes. Travel without parents or children does not mean travel without siblings or sprout. If we try to see the impact on survived in terms travel alone or with a company, we need to re-engineer these attributes. It is a good point anyway and give another task for <strong>data preprocess </strong> to do.</p>

<p>The same tickets number has such a small number. It does not have any statistical meaning. It is possible to reengineer <em>ticket</em> number into groups like “number only” vs “with letter” or “with special characters”, or simply group them with the length of the ticket or with the initials, etc. There is a lot of thing you can do to see if there is any patterns connected with the survival.</p>
<p>Over all, <em>Ticket</em> has a good quality and has no missing value and errors (we dont count repeated ticket number is an error). However, there is no obvious relations with the survive rate.</p>

<div id="fare" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.10</span> Fare</h3>
<p>The value of <em>Fare</em> are expected associated with “passenger’s wealth”. You would naturally associate its value with cabin condition and perhaps location of he cabin. Let us assess its value quality.</p>

<pre><code>## [1] 282</code></pre>
<p>The initial assessment tells us that:
1. The value of <code>Fare</code> has one missing value.
2. They are 282 different prices among 1308 tickets.
3. The minimum value is 0 (Free ride?) and the maximum value is 512.329.
4. The mean value is 33.295 and the median is only 14.454.
5. There are two potential issues in here: 512.329 is extremely higher than others, it could be considered as an outlier or an error; another potential issue is the precision. Any currency cannot have a physical money which carry value three digits after the decimal point. so any value has three digits after decimal point could be an error.</p>
<p>Let us examine the prediction power of attribute <em>Fare</em>.</p>

<p>It is not clear about <em>Fare</em> prediction power. One thing is clear that to be useful for predcition, Fare needs more engineer such as group it in different groups like &lt;5, 5 to 10, 10 to 15, …, etc.</p>

<p>Since the small number of passenger in each cabin, we accumulate passenger with the first latter of the cabin number. That means we bin the passengers based on the first letter of their cabin number. Then we plot the survived number over the total number.</p>

Its prediction power is in serious doubt since it only has very small number for each cabin. To use it in any possible predictio model, it needs some re-engineering.</p>

<p>The plot shows that both death and survive number distribution are similar. Southampton takes most death and survive portion because it has the largest number of passenger get on board, then Cherbourg, and last is Queenstown. However, in terms of death rate, which is the death/total from the passenger who get on board, southampton is the is the highest and then Queenstown, teh last is Cherbourg. That is to say, people who boarded from Cherbourg had a higher chance of survival than people who boarded from Southampton or Queenstown.</p>
<p>In summary, we have explored all attributes through descriptive analysis, which is mainly using numbers and through exploratory analysis, which is using plot. We have examined the quality of each attributes by finding missing values and duplication. We have spoted some outliars and odd values.</p>
<p>We have also assessed relationship between attribute <em>Survived</em> and all other attributes. The prediction power of each attributes have been understand to some extend. More prediction power study such as combination of two or three attributes are needed.</p>
<p>The findings of each attributes provide tasks and goals for data preprocess step to accomplish.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.6</span> Data Recods Level Assessment</h2>
<p>Although we have examined the raw datasets records’ numbers in attributes level. We have a good knowledge about the record numbers in each given dataset. It is still necessary to check at the record level. It means if there some records have too many missing attributes’ value, for example, although some records have ids and may be names but most of the useful attributes’ value are missing. These records are bed or invalid records, should be removed or solve the missing values.</p>
<p>On other hand some records have most attributes values are identical. These could be considered as duplicates. depends on the problem to be solved, they could be problematic and need to be dealt with.</p>
<p>In our Titanic problem, record level assessment is not an issue. Since we have almost all the records are different. This does not mean we should completely ignore this step and doing the checking.</p>

<div id="summary" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>All the analyses actions provide demonstrations how to access the raw data and understand their quantity and data quality. Notice that the understanding data is never a single one-off action. You never fully understood the given data. once the analytical process moving on, you may need to come back to apply some new decomposition on some attributes to explore more.</p>
<p>Since our raw data is not too big in terms of both the number of records and the number of attributes. So it is relatively easy to assess their quality. In a real world project the raw data can be huge or can be too little. To perform an effective analysis you may need to reduce the data size or in other cases to increase the size. It means you need to do sampling on the given datasets and probably attributes selection too. Other cases you may need to create new attributes or combine a few attribute together. These are called attributes re-engineering. They are the part of important tasks in data preprocess , which is covered in the next chapter on <strong>data preprocess</strong>.</p>

<p>Extract ticket class from ticket number¶</p>
<p>The purposes of data preprocess is to make data suitable for analyzing.</p>
<p>I this particular project, the purpose is to predict passengers survival. whatever a prediction model we may come up with, it should reflect the relations between other data attributes with the special one, which is “survived”. So the data preprocess, whatever actions we are take, should focused on the attributes that has relations with the survive, or our preprocess should help to enhance the attribute’s prediction power. An example is, “PassengerId”, it has no relation with the survive, apart from to identify a passenger, its prediction power is 0. so there should be any efforts on this attributes apart from make sure its unique.</p>
<p>Therefor it make sense to explore all attributes with surviels.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Survived
The first attribute reported if a traveler lived or died. A comparison revealed that more than 61% of the passengers had died.</li>

<p>完成数据的基本探索后，在建立模型之前，我们还需要对数据进行清洗，并且对数据集中缺失的数据进行补全。</p>
<p>首先了解数据的缺失情况：</p>
<p>To begin this step, we first import our data. Next we use the info() and sample() function, to get a quick and dirty overview of variable datatypes (i.e. qualitative vs quantitative). Click here for the Source Data Dictionary.</p>
<p>The Survived variable is our outcome or dependent variable. It is a binary nominal datatype of 1 for survived and 0 for did not survive. All other variables are potential predictor or independent variables. It’s important to note, more predictor variables do not make a better model, but the right variables.
The PassengerID and Ticket variables are assumed to be random unique identifiers, that have no impact on the outcome variable. Thus, they will be excluded from analysis.
The Pclass variable is an ordinal datatype for the ticket class, a proxy for socio-economic status (SES), representing 1 = upper class, 2 = middle class, and 3 = lower class.
The Name variable is a nominal datatype. It could be used in feature engineering to derive the gender from title, family size from surname, and SES from titles like doctor or master. Since these variables already exist, we’ll make use of it to see if title, like master, makes a difference.
The Sex and Embarked variables are a nominal datatype. They will be converted to dummy variables for mathematical calculations.
The Age and Fare variable are continuous quantitative datatypes.
The SibSp represents number of related siblings/spouse aboard and Parch represents number of related parents/children aboard. Both are discrete quantitative datatypes. This can be used for feature engineering to create a family size and is alone variable.
The Cabin variable is a nominal datatype that can be used in feature engineering for approximate position on ship when the incident occurred and SES from deck levels. However, since there are many null values, it does not add value and thus is excluded from analysis.</p>
