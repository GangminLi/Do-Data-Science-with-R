This book is originated from my Data Science course. It was in the lab sessions, where students practice different steps in the workflow of Data Science projects. Students enjoyed the detailed practices using different methods and different algorithms to solve analytical problems. To my surprise, we only find out later, that the student failed to grasp the real meaning of doing data science, which is not to provide an absolutely working solution to a problem, rather, an experimental interpretation of data at hand. In other words, you are just telling other propel what the data is telling you. You are not using data to solve problems that data has not provide any solution to you! They appeared also lost the track of doing a data science project. stuck at circles between two steps and failed to move foreword. 

I did a short tutorial for my students. the tutorial was emphasizing on the process and workflow of doing a data science project. That short tutorial was extremely successful and welcomed by all students, particularly the students who is not from computer Science, software engineering, Statistics, applied math, rather, from information science and management science. 

So, I suppose this book is practical for students who has no background of computing and programming knowledge but interested in doing data science project or move to data science in the future. 

It is introduction level book for novelty students who want learn data science in short period time perhaps a few days or at their winter or summer holidays.
