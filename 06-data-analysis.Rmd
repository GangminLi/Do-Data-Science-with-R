## models:Prediction

This was a case of classification problem and I tried predicting with two algorithms â€”
decision trees
Random Forest
Gaussian Naive Bayes
I was surprised at the results. The Gaussian Naive algorithm performed poorly and the Random Forest on the other hand was consistently predicting with an accuracy of more than 80%.
