```{r fig.align = 'center', out.width = "60%", echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "hotstove.jpg"))

You now know it is hot. don't you?

How?

Because, you'v touched it!

## What is this book? Why to read it?
This book is originated from my Data Science course. It was in the lab sessions, where students practice different steps in the workflow of Data Science projects. Students enjoyed the detailed practices using different methods and different algorithms to solve analytical problems. To my surprise, we only find out later, that the student failed to grasp the real meaning of doing data science, which is not to provide an absolutely working solution to a problem, rather, an experimental interpretation of data at hand. In other words, you are just telling other propel what the data is telling you. You are not using data to solve problems that data has not provide any solution to you! They appeared also lost the track of doing a data science project. stuck at circles between two steps and failed to move foreword. 

I did a short tutorial for my students. the tutorial was emphasizing on the process and workflow of doing a data science project. That short tutorial was extremely successful and welcomed by all students, particularly the students who is not from computer Science, software engineering, Statistics, applied math, rather, from information science and management science. 

So, I suppose this book is practical for students who has no background of computing and programming knowledge but interested in doing data science project or move to data science in the future. 

It is introduction level book for novelty students who want learn data science in short period time perhaps a few days or at their winter or summer holidays.  

## Structure of the Book

## What Can This Course Offer You?

This book offers a short practical course.  

This course will bring you:

1. Understand the data analysis procedure
2. Familiar with R language 
3. Using RStudio to do your prototype of data project
4. Data preprocess - manipulate data for further analysis
3. Manage basic methods like Descriptive, Exploratory and Predictive data analysis
5. Have basic skills of visualize data results
6. Basic interpretation of you analyzing results and communicate with others
7. Report your results 
8. Enter the data science community


## Schedule

is specifically designed for students who has no background of much Algorithms, programming and even computing. The basic requirements are desire to learn, attitude of humble and diligence of working. All that mean you need to get your hand dirty, spent time and do more practices. At the end, it cannot guaranty you become a data scientist but it will help you find the way to wards doing data science and be confident to start doing data science projects. It is certainty that if you persist on this road, you will no doubt becomes a future data scientist.

## Notes
Our goal is not to teach you R, but to teach you the basic process of doing a data science project that many other  programming language like Java and Python can do. We use R in our lessons because:

+ we have to use something for examples;
+ it’s free, well-documented, and runs almost everywhere;
+ it has a large (and growing) user base among scientists; and
+ it has a large library of external packages available for performing diverse tasks.

But the two most important things are to use whatever language your colleagues are using, so you can share your work with them easily, and to use that language well. apparently. R is the most used language in Data Science
