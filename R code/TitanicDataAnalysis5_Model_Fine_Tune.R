# Survived is our response variable and the rest can be predictors except pasengerID.

rf.label <- as.factor(train$Survived)

# RandomForest cannot handle factors with over 53 levels

rf.1 <- randomForest(x = rf.train, y = rf.label, importance = TRUE)

# Check the order of the predictors prediction power.
pre.or <- sort(rf.1$importance[,3], decreasing = TRUE)

## The idea in here is using the predictors order (prediction)
# to build all models each has one predictor less. so we can
# compare models to find which is has the best accuracy
# WE can take that model as the best to bench marking the predictor.

# rf.2 as an example

### The 1 sampling methods: 10 Folds CV Repeat 10 Times

# check to see if the samples are the same or close to the same ratio

# Set up caret's trainControl object using 10-folds repeated CV
ctrl.1 <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", number = 10, repeats = 10, index = cv.10.folds)

# Model construction with "`10-folds repeated CV`" is a very expensive
# R has a package called **"doSNOW"**, that facilities the use of
# multi-core processor and permits parallel computing in
# a pseudo cluster mode

## Set up doSNOW package for multi-core training.
# cl <- makeCluster(6, type = "SOCK")

# # Set seed for reproducibility and train
# set.seed(34324)

# prediction accuracy reduced from 0.8642 to 0.8511,
# but not pessimistic enough to the test accuracy, it is 0.75598.

### The 2 sampling methods: 5 Folds CV Repeat 10 Times

rf.8.cv.2

# We can see that 5-fold CV is a little better.
# The accuracy is moved under 85%. The model's training data set
# is moved from 9/10 to 4/5, which is 713 now.

### The 3 sampling methods: 3 Folds CV Repeat 10 Times
#
set.seed(37596)

# save(rf.8.cv.3, file = "rf.8.cv.3.rda")
# # # Check out results
load("rf.8.cv.3.rda")
# Check out results
rf.8.cv.3

# We can see the accuracy has further decreased (0.8387579).
# Let us also reduced the number of times that the samples
# are repeated used in the training (repeat times).
# Let us see if the sample repeat times reduce to 3,
# if the accuracy can be further reduced.
