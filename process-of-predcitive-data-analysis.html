<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Process of predcitive data analysis</h2>
<p>The process of predictive data analysis is called <strong>predictive modeling</strong>. It is generally involves three steps: <strong>Predictor selection</strong>, <strong>model construction</strong> and <strong>model evaluation</strong>.</p>
<div id="predictor-selection" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Predictor Selection</h3>
<p>Predictor, in data science, is an attribute that a prediction model used to predict values of another attribute. The attribute to be predicted is called <strong>consequencer</strong> (or <strong>dependent</strong>, or <strong>response</strong>). Generally, an data object can have a large number of attributes, which can potentially be used as predictors by a model to produce consequencer. Most models do not use all of the data attributes, instead only a number of selected attributes are used.</p>
<p>The selection is based on the relationship between predictor and the consequencer and also the relationship among the predictors. <strong>Filter</strong> and <strong>wrapper</strong> are the most common methods used in the attributes selection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Filters</strong>. Filters is a method that examines each predictor in turn. A numerical measure is calculated, representing the strength of the correlation<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> between the predictor attribute and the consequencer. This correlation is conventionally called prediction power of a predictor in the prediction modeling. Only predictor attributes where the correlation measure<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> exceeds a given threshold are selected or simple select the fixed number of the top attributes which has higher correlation measure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wrappers</strong>. A wrapper takes a group of predictors and considers the “value add” of each attribute compared to other attributes in the group. If two attributes tell you more or less the same thing (e.g. age and date of birth) then one will be discarded because it adds no value. Step-wise linear regression<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and principal component analysis<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> are two popular wrapper methods.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="model-construction" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> Model Construction</h3>
<p>Model construction is the center of the data analyzing. It normally involves two phases: <strong>induction</strong> and <strong>deduction</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Induction is also called model learning, which means learn to predict;</p></li>
<li><p>Deduction is called model application, which means model applied to predict.
The division of model learn and model application allows a predictive model to be mature while induction using <strong>training dataset</strong> to construct a model and deduction using <strong>testing dataset</strong> to test and adjust the model constructed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are many predictive models exists for different purposes. Many different methods can be used to create a model, and more are being developed all the time. Three broad predictive models based on the model format and the way it is built are <strong>Math model</strong>, <strong>Rule-based model</strong> and <strong>Machine Learning model</strong>.</p>
<div id="math-model" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Math model</h4>
<p>Mathematical formulated model is the model produced by mathematical formula which combines multiple predictors (attributes) to predict a response (we called it targeted attribute). A predictor is a single attribute in a data object that contributes to the result of the prediction, which is consequencer (also called dependents in same applications).</p>
<p>A well-known example of math model is <strong>Regression model</strong>. A linear regression model is a target function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> that maps each attribute set <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> into a continuous-valued output <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> with minimum error.</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:binom">\[\begin{equation} 
  y = f(x) = f(x)= ω_1 x+ω_0,
  \tag{1.1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(ω_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(ω_1\)</span> are parameters of the model and are called the <em>regression coefficients</em>. The model is to find the parameters <span class="math inline">\((ω_1, ω_0)\)</span> that minimize the sum of the squared error (SSE),</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:sse">\[\begin{equation} 
 SSE= \Sigma^{N}_{i=1}[y_i-f(x_i)]^2 = \Sigma^{N}_{i=1}[y_i - ω_1 x + ω_0 ]^2
  \tag{1.2}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Clearly the linear regression is very simple, its prediction is also limited. So you can have more complicated models like <strong>Logistic Regression</strong> and <strong>Support victor machine (SVM)</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="rule-based-model" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Rule-based model</h4>
<p>In a rule-based model, the model is a collection of rules. For example a model for customer retention may be something like,</p>
<p><code>if the customer is rural, and her monthly usage is high, then the customer will probably renew.</code></p>
<p>In rule-based model, a model is a collection of <code>if … then …</code> rules. List below shows an example of a classification model generated by a rule-based classifier for the vertebrate classification problem.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation} 
r_1:  (Gives Birth = no) ∧ (Aerial Creature = yes) → Birds\\
r_2:    (Gives Birth = no) ∧ (Aquatic Creature = yes) → Fishes\\
r_3:    (Gives Birth = yes) ∧ (Body Temperature = warm-blooded) → Mammals\\
r_4:    (Gives Birth = no) ∧ (Aerial Creature = no) → Reptiles\\
r_5:    (Aquatic Creature = semi) → Amphibians
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The rules for the model are represented in a disjunctive normal form <span class="math inline">\(R=(r_1 \vee r_2\vee … \vee r_k)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is known as the rule set and <span class="math inline">\(r_i\)</span> are the model rules.
Each rule is expressed in a form of:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:rule">\[\begin{equation} 
r_i:   (Condition_i) →  y_i.
  \tag{1.3}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The left-hand side of the rule is called the <strong>rule antecedent or precondition</strong>. It contains a conjunction of attribute test:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:condition">\[\begin{equation} 
condition_i = (A_1\quad op\quad v_1 ) ∧ (A_2\quad op\quad v_2 ) ∧ … ∧(A_k\quad  op\quad v_k ),
  \tag{1.4}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\((A_j\quad op\quad v_j )\)</span> is an attribute-value pair and <span class="math inline">\(op\)</span> is a relation operator chosen from the set <span class="math inline">\(\{ =, ≠, &lt;, &gt;, ≤, ≥ \}\)</span>. Each attribute test <span class="math inline">\((A_j\quad op \quad v_j )\)</span> is known as a conjunct. The right hand of the rule is called the rule consequent which contains the value of conceqencer <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="machine-learning-model" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Machine Learning Model</h4>
<p>In many applications the relationship between the predictor and the concequencer is non-deterministic or is too difficult to either formulate a model or figure out rules by human. In these cases, advanced technologies are used to generate prediction models automatically taking advantage of massive computer storage and fast computation power of distributed and cloud based computing infrastructure. The models used in these situations are mostly mathematical formula and even Neural Networks (NN). Expression <a href="process-of-predcitive-data-analysis.html#eq:ML">(1.5)</a> is a good illustration.</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:ML">\[\begin{equation} 

Input → f(w_1,w_2, ...,w_n) → Output

\tag{1.5}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>In the machine learning, different predictive models are utilized and tested to produce a valid prediction such as <strong>regression</strong>, <strong>decision tree</strong>, and <strong>decision forest</strong>, etc.</p>
<p>The Machine Leaning approach also takes a <em>“black box”</em> approach that is ignoring the detailed transformation between predictors and the consequence, and simply simulating input and out through NN. Neural Network modeling heavily relies on features engineering that is features extraction and features selection. One way to overcome this problem is an approach called <strong>Deep Leaning</strong>. Deep learning is built based on the concept of NN and adds extra layers between the input and the output layers. Figure <a href="process-of-predcitive-data-analysis.html#fig:diff">1.2</a> shows the differences between Machine Learning and Deep Learning.</p>

<p>There are three important types of neural networks that are also called pre-trained models in deep learning: <strong>Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)</strong>, <strong>Convolution Neural Networks (CNN)</strong> and <strong>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)</strong>. We will not use them but it is good to understand what are they.</p>
<p>In practices, predictive models used in a Data Science project are mostly mathematics formulated models. They are implemented in different computer program with different languages. They are normally packed into integrated software packages. This software undertakes a mixture of training data and goes through number crunching, parameter adjustment and error correction, which normally called trial or training, and finally produces a working prediction model. During the process of machine generating model, human involvement is much less but needed. It enables fine tune the model and improving on its performance.</p>

</div>
<div id="model-validation" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span> Model Validation</h3>
<p>A major problem when building models is that it is relatively easy to build a prediction model but it is not easy to prove the model is useful. That is to say finding relationships that are exist and are the result of random patterns in the training and testing datasets, but this relationship may not exist in the unseen datasets. Model validation is the task of confirming that the outputs of a model have enough fidelity to the outputs of the model building process that the objectives of the model can be achieved.</p>
<p>In practice, a model can be <strong>over-fitted</strong> or <strong>under-fitted</strong>. An over-fitted model can perform extremely good in the test with the test dataset but perform significantly worse with new unseen dataset. In other words, the over-fitted model remembers a huge number of examples from training dataset instead of learning to notice features of the training dataset. On other hand, an under-fitted model misses some features or patterns that exist in the training dataset. Under-fitting would occur, for example, when fitting a linear model to non-linear data. Both over-fitted and under-fitted model will tend to have poor predictive performance.</p>
<p>To determine if over-fitting has occurred, the model needs to be tested on “<strong>validation dataset</strong>”. Validation datasets is a subset from the given datasets that have targeted attributes values. This subset was not used to construct the model. Validation dataset is genially taken from the training datasets with certain percentage.</p>
<p>Over-fitting is quite common and this is not necessarily a problem. However, if the degree of over-fitting is large, the model may need to be reconstructed using a different set of attributes.</p>
<p>Apart from checking model’s over-fitting, Depends on the model being constructed, there a number of evaluation methods are available to perform the model validation such as <strong>Confusion Matrix</strong> for nominal output like class labels, <strong>AUC (Area Under Curve)</strong>, <strong>accuracy</strong> and other evaluation metrics are used for evaluate different models.</p>
